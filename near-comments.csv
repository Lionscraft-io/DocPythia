Once the protocol voting starts at Tuesday, October 28th, 2025, at 01:00:00 UTC, validators will start providing their version in block headers as well as it can be queried from the debug RPC.

With the help of Near One, we've got a script that returns the version of the protocol for each validator. This can be queried from an RPC node with debug mode enabled. The actual protocol version will start to appear after the voting.

No defi. No killer apps. Negative Founder growth. Anemic Community.  No eco growth funding or plan. AI not near.

Cutting 30m near in emissions a year do little to address any of the above.

The only working economy on near is the staking economy. The validator economy.

The staking economy for 5% inflation. No reason to hold near other than staking.

Of the 60m near per year in inflation the largest percent goes to top 10 validators and their stakers. While the reduction makes bottom 100 lose without massive growth.

Without real growth strategies you lose stakers as they exit as their rewards were halfed. Numbers go down.

Repeating “no DeFi, no growth, no community” doesn’t make it true. You’re trying to distort perception — but the reality is different.

Projects are building, integrations are happening, funds are moving, and NEAR tech is being used in real products. Things are progressing — maybe not loudly, but consistently.

Saying “numbers don’t lie” while showing none is the real irony. Reducing inflation by 3% isn’t a gimmick — it’s a signal of maturity and stability that helps attract long-term investors and strengthen the network’s fundamentals.

And here’s the contradiction: you’re asking for a “growth strategy,” yet you’re rejecting the step that makes it possible.
The old mindset — “as long as we get 5% yield” — keeps the network in the past. Real growth means giving NEAR purpose beyond inflation rewards.

You ask, “What’s your plan?”
The plan is simple: make NEAR worth holding not for payouts, but for participation in an ecosystem that’s evolving. That’s how you move forward — not by insisting everything’s broken.

Dear validators,

This 2.9.0 release is NOT mandatory — it starts the voting phase for Protocol Version 81, which proposes reducing NEAR’s maximum inflation rate from 5% → 2.5%.

🗳 What to Do Now

✅ Support the reduction (reward /2):
➡️ Upgrade your node to 2.9.0 to participate in the “YES” vote.

❌ Do NOT support the change:
➡️ Stay on 2.8.0 to maintain a “NO” vote stance.

⚠️ If you already upgraded but do not support the reduction,
you can downgrade to 2.8.0 to vote “NO.”

⏱️ After Voting

🟩 If the vote PASSES, an announcement will follow.
Validators on 2.8.0 will have ~8 hours after the voting epoch ends to upgrade to 2.9.0 before Protocol v81 activates.

In the case that the voting does not go through in the specified timeline, we will provide instruction on how to safely off-board the 2.9 binary.
